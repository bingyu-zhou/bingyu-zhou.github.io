         How the Ubiquity of Mobile Phones Is Unleashing an Entrepreneurial Revolution
     <h1>

     <p>
       The spread of mobile technology throughout low-income countries has given rise to prominent entrepreneurs like Indian-born Sunil Mittal and Sudanese-born Mo Ibrahim, who took the initiative to introduce the technology in large parts of India and Africa, respectively. Entrepreneurs like Mittal and Ibrahim, along with major mobile phone operators, have succeeded in making mobiles virtually universal and have deservedly become highly visible industrial leaders and role models for younger generations in terms of how to create new success stories. Mobiles them- selves are in turn now unleashing thousands, if not millions, of entrepreneurs in low-income countries. These new entrepreneurs are less visible but nonetheless contributing to a dispersed entrepreneurial ecology on the ground that will change lives, create innovations, and strengthen democratic forces.

       Take the case of the Model T a century ago; Henry Ford, in this case, would be the equivalent of Sunil Mittal or Mo Ibrahim. When these affordable cars first came out, their users travelled much faster, thus saving time and accomplishing more. The ensuing economic benefits allowed users to advance materially and gain the ability to purchase other goods and services. This created an opportunity for entrepreneurs to produce and sell these other goods and services. This is the cate- gory I call Form. Next, as the affordable cars became widely available, it became
       possible to build larg- er factories away from residential settings, employing more workers dispersed over a wider area who could drive to work. Complementary but non-automotive assets such as better roads and highways were built to fully capitalize on the ben- efits of automobiles. Shopping malls out- side of city centers became desirable. With time, the econo- my adjusted to the new possibilities of automobiles. I label the entrepreneurs in this category of activ- ities—rethinking and reworking solutions to the needs of the economy—as Transform. Finally, a third set of activities were launched to pro- duce new kinds of vehicles (such as
       trucks, vans, buses) on the original automobile Platform, to capitalize not just on the automobiles but also on the emerging complementary assets such roads and highways. Transform and Platform, moreover, in producing more value in the economy, gave rise to greater purchasing power and strengthened the impact of Form.

       By exploring these categories, we can better understand the different entrepre- neurs who emerge from each phase of the co-evolution between a widely accepted technology, such as the mobile phones, and an economy. Entrepreneurs, in their own self-interest, capitalize on this co-evolution, but also in turn advance it. They benefit and are benefited by the blossoming of a technology.
